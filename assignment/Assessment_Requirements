Assessment Problems

Follow the assessment instructions and guidance closely to ensure you solve the following problems correctly.

Problem 1: Data from yfinance

Using the yfinance Python package, 

write a function called get_data() 
Downloads all hourly data for the previous five days for the five FAANG stocks:

    Facebook (META)
    Apple (AAPL)
    Amazon (AMZN)
    Netflix (NFLX)
    Google (GOOG)

Save the data into a folder called data in the root of your repository
Filename must use the format YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.csv 
where YYYYMMDD is the four-digit year (e.g. 2025), followed by the two-digit month (e.g. 09 for September), followed by the two digit day, and HHmmss is hour, minutes, seconds. 
Create the data folder if you don't already have one.

Problem 2: Plotting Data

Write a function called plot_data() 
Plot_data() must acceess the latest data file in the data folder 
on one plot, plots the Close prices for each of the five stocks. 

The plot should include axis labels, a legend, and the date as a title. 
Save the plot into a plots folder in the root of your repository using a filename in the format YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.png. 
Create the plots folder if you don't already have one.

Problem 3: Script

Create a Python script called faang.py in the root of your repository. 
Copy the above functions into it 
Whenever someone at the terminal types ./faang.py, the script runs, downloading the data and creating the plot. 
Note that this will require a shebang line and the script to be marked executable. 
Explain the steps you took in your notebook.

Problem 4: Automation

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run your script every Saturday morning. 
The script should be called faang.yml in a .github/workflows/ folder in the root of your repository. 
In your notebook, explain each of the individual lines in your workflow.
